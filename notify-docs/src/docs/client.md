The **Notify.ai Client SDK** is a lightweight Java library that integrates into Spring Boot applications. Using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and custom annotations, it intercepts methods, packages parameters as semantic event payloads, and transmits them to the control plane (`acp-server`).

## 🚀 Integration Guide

### 1. Add Dependencies
Add the client SDK and annotations dependencies to your application's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.notify</groupId>
  <artifactId>vocabulary-agent-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.notify</groupId>
  <artifactId>vocabulary-agent-annotations</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Enable the SDK
Annotate a configuration class with `@EnableNotify` and specify the packages to scan:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableNotify(basePackage = "com.myapp")
public class NotifyConfig {}
```

### 3. Application Properties
Configure connection parameters in your `application.yml` or `application.properties`:

```yaml
notify:
  base-package: com.myapp
  acp-server-url: http://localhost:8080
  application-name: my-service
  buffer-batch-size: 100
  buffer-flush-timeout-ms: 5000
  # Optional: Kafka integration for scheduled events
  kafka-enabled: false
  kafka-topic: notify-scheduled-events
  kafka-group: notify-client-group
```

## 🛠️ Key Annotations

| Annotation | Level | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `@EnableNotify` | Class | Enables the SDK; specifies packages to scan. |
| `@Event` | Method | Intercepts execution and forwards payloads to the control plane. |
| `@Rule` | Method | Executes vocabulary rules before/after events. |
| `@Callback` | Method | BEFORE/AFTER hooks running custom logic surrounding event capture. |
| `@Vocabulary` | Field | Declares a field as a vocabulary attribute on model classes. |
| `@Model` | Class | Exposes all fields of the class as vocabulary attributes. |
| `@VocabularySupplier`| Method | Supplies additional context/payload mappings. |
| `@SubjectSupplier` | Method | Maps recipients/subjects for notifications. |

## 🚀 Local Compilation

As a client SDK library, this module cannot be run on its own. It is compiled and installed locally, then imported by your applications.

To compile and package the client SDK locally:
```bash
mvn clean install -pl client
```

For examples of how this SDK is utilized in active projects, refer to the [examples/ecommerce-app](file:///Users/rohannaik/Desktop/notify/examples/ecommerce-app/README.md) and [examples/banking-app](file:///Users/rohannaik/Desktop/notify/examples/banking-app/README.md) directories.
